# AngularJS Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs

This plugin provides support for AngularJS and Angular 2 projects in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm Professional and RubyMine.

It provides intelligent Angular-specific code completion, navigation and refactoring. 

The plugin bundles a collection of AngularJS code templates by [Pawel Kozlowski](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource) and a collection of Angular 2 code templates by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa), adapted to WebStorm by [Reto Ryter](https://github.com/rryter).

## Getting started

1. If you’re using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm or RubyMine, install AngularJS plugin in Preferences | Plugins - Install JetBrains plugins.
2. Open your Angular project.
3. Make sure that you have AngularJS/Angular 2 library files in your project (for example, in the node_modules folder) or AngularJS/Angular2 is configured as a JavaScript external library in the IDE as described [here](http://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2014/07/how-webstorm-works-completion-for-javascript-libraries/) – this is required for the IDE to enable Angular support for this project.
